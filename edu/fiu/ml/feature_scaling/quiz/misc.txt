Which of the following algorithms is affected by feature scaling?

1)Decision Tree
They aren't going to give the diagonal lines. They give series of vertical and horizontal lines which wont be effected by the scales.

2)SVM with RBF kernel
In SVM, the distance calculation (distance between the points and the hyperplane) tradeoffs between one dimension to the other, i.e. if we scale
one dimension twice as the other, it counts twice as much.

3) Linear Regression
Each feature has a co-efficient and that co-efficient and feature go together. what's going with feature a wont affect the coefficient of feature b. So the scaling doesn't affect at all.

4)K-Means clustering
The distance of a point from the cluster centre tradeoffs between one dimension to the other. Similar effect to the SVM will be observed.
